ECE 514 Random Process - Project I 

This project involves simulation, transformation and convergence of Random Variables using 
concepts underlined in:
“Understanding Convergence Concepts: A Visual-Minded and Graphical Simulation- Based Approach'

SIMULATION:
File Name: project_part1_main.m 
includes the generation of Random Variables: Normal, Exponential and Uniform, through Matlab 
Routines and Rejection Method. Mean and Variance with respect to the expected results is 
calculated.
Uses Functions (Rejection Method): exprej.m , normrej.m, unirej.m  

TRANSFORMATION:
transformation_project.m 
This file involves transformation of the simulated random variables inorder to prove the 
Central Limit Theorem.
Uses Function: transform.m

CONVERGENCE:
The Graphical Simulation is carried out using App Desiner (Matlab). Convergence of Y generated 
using three different distribution schemes namely, Normal, Uniform and Exponential is carried 
out.
File Name: ConvergenceTest
Uses Functions: convergence_expo.m, convergence_uni.m and convergence_norm.m
